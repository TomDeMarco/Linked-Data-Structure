# Linked-Data-Structure

Background:
This data structure is an array of linked lists. First, an alphabet is created. An alphabet in this sense is a char represented by a number. The alphabet we used in this assignment was supposed to represent the different bases of a DNA molecule. Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, and Thymine were each assigned the number 1,2,3, and 4, respectively. Lastly, the bases are always represented in pairs. 

Implementation:
Each index of the array was a Linkedlist that each node represented an occurance of that base. Since the bases are in pairs, each node contains data of the next base in the list, which is also the second base in the pair.
